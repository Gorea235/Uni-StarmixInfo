# Starmix Info
The website we have to use for the SEPR project.

I plan to make the site in such a way that we can change the information on it without requiring a change of the source + redeployment. It will be hosted on Amazon AWS as I'm buying domains through them anyway, and so they will give me the 12 month free trial of their services, which includes a database and hosted virtual machine.

While I will try to allow most changes to go through the site, I am going to make deployment to the server manageable via scripts (since it's something I need to get working for another future project), so I won't mind making changes.
