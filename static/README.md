# Static Pages
Since we have completed this project, this site is now a purely archive site for the project we did. Since it's now an archive, we no longer need the full server running constantly, since the main purpose was to allow us to have an easy to update site for the duration of the project. As this is no longer a requirement, and we also have the requirement of easy to manage archival site with low overhead, I have decided to convert the whole site to static pages, and use nginx to serve them.

The entire site is hosted in an nginx container, and it is set up such that it mimics the full site exactly.
